# STAT 1601 Final Proect
Final data visualization for STAT 1601 at the University of Virginia. To run our code and print the graphs, please make sure to set your working directory to the desired folder. You can do this by running the following command:
```
setwd("/path/to/your/directory")
```
Then, make sure that the survey results file named mxmh_survey_results.csv is in the same directory as the R script. You can then run the R script named final_project.R to see the graphs we created.
